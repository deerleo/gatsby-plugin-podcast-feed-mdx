# gatsby-plugin-podcast-feed-mdx

This [Gatsby plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/) will generate a podcast rss feed that is published on your site.

It can be used to submit to podcast directories such as [Apple Podcasts](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/), [Stitcher](https://partners.stitcher.com/join), [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/), [Google Podcasts](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/podcast-overview), [TuneIn Radio](https://tunein.com/podcasts/), [Pandora](https://www.ampplaybook.com/podcasts), [Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/submit/), [iHeartRadio](https://www.iheart.com/content/submit-your-podcast/), [AnyPod](https://anypod.net/publish) etc...

The section in the feed that describes the podcast itself is based on values configured in your `gatsby-config` file.

Descriptions for each episode are generated based on values configured within individual mdx files, i.e. one for each episode.

The feed will be written out to a site root-relative path specified in `gatsby-config`.

## Pre-requisites

This plugin assumes the following:

1. You are using [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) in your site to generate pages from markdown files.
2. You will have one markdown file per podcast episode.

## Output

The main output of this plugin is an rss file for a podcast.

The structure of the generated rss file has been designed to support [Apple Podcasts requirements](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390) and [Google Feed requirements](https://developers.google.com/search/reference/podcast/rss-feed)

The rss file is generated when you run `gatsby build`. (*note: the rss file is **not** generated when you run* `gatsby develop`)
